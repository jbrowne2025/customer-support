# Bookly Support Agent

A prototype customer support agent for **Bookly**, a fictional online bookstore. Built for the Decagon Solutions Engineering take-home: a Node/Express backend that orchestrates Claude's native tool use against order data and a policy knowledge base, and a React chat UI on top.

Handles three intents end to end:

- **Order status** — looks up live order data by account email from a Supabase `bookly_orders` table
- **Returns/refunds** — collects order, item, reason, and refund method, then enforces Bookly's return policy in code: a 30-day return window, explicit confirmation of the card on file before refunding to it, and mandatory human review for every return regardless of amount — no refund is auto-approved. Sourced from the same Supabase `bookly_orders` table as order status
- **General policy questions** — shipping, returns, payments, password reset, cancellation — answered via a `search_policies` tool instead of the model's own memory

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+ (built and tested on Node 22)
- An Anthropic API key with access to `claude-opus-4-8`
- A Supabase project with a `bookly_orders` table (see below) — optional; without it, `lookup_order` and `initiate_return` return a clear "not configured" error instead of crashing, and `search_policies` still works

## Setup

```bash
# Server
cd server
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # fill in ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, and SUPABASE_URL / SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY if you have a project
npm run dev             # http://localhost:8787

# Client (separate terminal)
cd ../client
npm install
npm run dev              # http://localhost:5174
```

Open http://localhost:5174. The Vite dev server proxies `/api/*` to the Express server on port 8787, so no CORS config is needed in dev.

## Try it

- **Order status + clarifying question:** "Where's my order?" → the agent asks for your account email (and optionally an order number) before calling `lookup_order`. Try any email that has a row in your Supabase `bookly_orders` table.
- **Multi-turn return flow:** "I want to return something" → the agent asks which order, which item, why, and how you'd like to be refunded, then calls `initiate_return`, reading item/delivery/payment detail from the same Supabase `bookly_orders` row. Pick any order in your table that's `delivered` and within 30 days of its `delivered_on` date to see it go eligible → details → confirmation → human review (every return goes to review, regardless of amount).
- **General question:** "How long do I have to return something?" or "How do I reset my password?" → answered via `search_policies`, not the model's own memory.

### Supabase table (single source of truth)

Both `lookup_order` and `initiate_return` read from the same table (default name `bookly_orders`, configurable via `SUPABASE_ORDERS_TABLE`), shaped like:

| column | type | used by |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | int8 | — |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | — |
| `order_number` | text | both |
| `order_status` | text | both |
| `order_amount` | numeric | `lookup_order` (list view only) |
| `order_primary_email` | text | both |
| `order_date_time` | timestamp | `lookup_order` (list view only) |
| `delivered_on` | date | `initiate_return` (30-day return window) |
| `payment_last4` | text | `initiate_return` (card confirmation before refunding to it) |
| `items` | jsonb — array of `{item_id, title, qty, price}` | `initiate_return` (which item is being returned, refund amount) |
| `customer_name` | text | both (returned for optional personalization; not otherwise used) |

If Row Level Security is enabled on this table (Supabase's default for new tables), use a **secret key** (`sb_secret_...`, Settings → API → Secret keys), not the publishable/anon key — the publishable key will silently return zero rows instead of erroring, which would make the agent tell every customer "no orders found." The secret key is safe here because `server/lib/supabaseClient.js` only ever runs server-side and is never sent to the browser; it should never be used in client-side code. (Projects still on Supabase's legacy key system can use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` instead — see `server/lib/supabaseClient.js` for the fallback order.)

## Architecture

```
client (React/Vite)  →  POST /api/chat  →  server (Express)
                                              │
                                     Claude tool-use loop
                                     (system prompt + tools)
                                              │
                    ┌─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┐
                    │                          │                         │
              lookup_order              initiate_return            search_policies
                    │                          │                         │
                    └──── Supabase `bookly_orders` table ────┘   local policy
                    (status/date/amount for lookup_order;        knowledge base
                     + items/delivered_on/payment_last4
                     for initiate_return)
```

- `server/lib/systemPrompt.js` — persona, scope, and guardrails (identity check before order actions, no fabricating order/policy details, explicit card confirmation before refunding, ask before assuming).
- `server/lib/tools.js` — tool schemas + execution. Business rules (identity match, 30-day return window, mandatory human review for every return, card confirmation) are enforced in code, not left to the model.
- `server/lib/supabaseClient.js` — lazy Supabase client; throws a clear, catchable error if unconfigured rather than crashing the server at boot.
- `server/lib/agent.js` — the tool-use loop: calls Claude, executes any requested tools, feeds results back, repeats until the model returns a final text answer (capped at 6 iterations).
- `server/index.js` — Express app; keeps an in-memory conversation history per `sessionId` (mock only — resets on restart).
- `client/src/App.jsx` — chat UI; shows a badge on any assistant turn that used a tool, so tool use is visible rather than hidden.

## Known limitations (by design, for a ~4hr scope)

- Conversation history is in-memory per server process — no persistence across restarts, no real auth (an email is treated as a lightweight identity check, not verified).
- `search_policies` is a simple keyword-overlap search, not embeddings/RAG — good enough to demonstrate the tool-use pattern, but it can rank a tangentially-related policy above the best match on ambiguous phrasing.
- No streaming — responses are returned as a single JSON payload per turn.
- Created returns (`initiate_return`) are still tracked in an in-memory array, not written back to Supabase — a real deployment would persist them.
